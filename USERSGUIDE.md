# Using snoods - a Simple shared whiteboard app 

After you start __snoods__, you should see the control panel
at the lower left of the __snoods__ window:

If you don't see this control panel, or the bottom part of it
is missing, then you might need to run __snoods__ with
a smaller whiteboard size (in order to ensure that it can
fit on your screen).
